# DS4002_CS3
This repository contains the hook document, rubric, data, and reference materials materials necessary to complete the study. The reference links are listed at the bottom of this **README.md** document. The deliverable will be a github repository link that contains the code for your sentiment analysis, the datasets used, any relevant references used, and a one page written summary of your results and takeaways from the project.

# Data
Two datasets were initially collected for this analysis. For both Simone Biles and Jonathan Owens, a dataset of 600 comments have been collected (**sb.csv** and **jo.csv** in the **DATA** folder). Each set of 600 comments are made up of 100 comments from the three posts made by each respective account immediately following the release of the controversial podcast episode, as well as 100 comments from each of the three pinned posts on each account. Cleaned versions of these datasets have also been provided in the **DATA** folder (**clean_sb.csv** and **clean_jo.csv**) and can be used in place of **jo.csv** and **sb.csv** if the student wants to use precleaned data.
